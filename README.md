# Cybersecurity-Projects

This repo consists of various labs Cybersecurity tools I have used in my personal practice and as a task in my current Internship position.
Below are a couple of the Softwares and what they were used for.

# Wireshark
Wireshark is an open-source network packet tracking software that helps in tracking network packets between connected devices via an Inerface.
It is a robust Software that can be used to perform Malware Analysis and to detect Malwares in a network.
I used wireshark 

# Thunderbird 
This is also an open source Software that is used to perform end-to-end-encryption on Emails between a sender and a recipient.
The Software enables messages sent in an email to be transmitted between the righful Sender and the Recipient.

HOW IT'S PERFORMED
1. Both Sender and receiver must compute a public key on the System to be used for encryption.
2. Since Public keys are public, the sender already has the public key of the recipient, so he or she encrypts the message with the sender's public key.

NB: In an Asymmetric Encryption Scheme, when a public key is used to encrypt a message, it's corresponding private key is used to decrypt the message.

3. When the recipient receives the email, he can open the message and read the content since he has the private key to open it.

# Checksum with SHA256sum
Due to the rise in Cyber attacks, it is prudent that every downloaded file is verified, in order to protect one's system.
With the help of the Checksum, it is possible to compute and compare the hash values of a downloaded file, with it's original hash value. 
This helps the users to be sure of having the Original file,
